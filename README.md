# MazeQ_Learning

This project is to explore the methodology of Q learning. This utlizaes the epsilon (exploration rate) greedy strategy. This learning technique will explore randomly and does not care if a state is explored or not. The object will keep exploring each state only if the decay of epsilon is within an accepted range at each step. 

Project Goals:
    1. Create object and board with interaction rules
    2. Apply q learning algorithm to object's behavior
    3. Create random maze generator to observe the behavior in various environments
    4. Document results
