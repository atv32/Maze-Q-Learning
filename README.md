# MazeQ_Learning

This project is to explore the methodology of Q learning. This utlizaes the epsilon (exploration rate) greedy strategy. This learning technique will explore randomly and does not care if a state is explored or not. The object will keep exploring each state only if the decay of epsilon is within an accepted range at each step. 

Project Goals:<br/>
Markup :    - [x] Create object and board with interaction rules<br/>
            - [x] Apply q learning algorithm to object's behavior<br/>
            - [ ] Create random maze generator to observe the behavior in various environments<br/>
            - [ ] Document results<br/> <br/>
